# Migration Guide
This is a guide to outline the process of migrating content from the old docs to here for anyone wishing to contribute.

The most important point to be aware of is that the new docs have a unified format with one set of copy across all the client SDKs. Notes realting to a specific SDK can be added, such as to mention that a feature is not implemented on all of the SDKs, however a universal explanation should be used where possible.

## Formatting
Please follow the formatting conversions for specific markdown elements between the old and new docs.
