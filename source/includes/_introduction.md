# Introduction

Welcome to the Parse Platform docs!

We have language bindings in Shell, Python, Swift, Objective-c and JavaScript! You can view code examples in the dark area to the right, and you can switch the programming language of the examples with the tabs in the top right.

All the docs are hosted on github on the [Parse Docs repo](https://github.com/Tom-Fox1/Parse-Docs) so If you find something missing or a section that needs improvement please make a pull request.
